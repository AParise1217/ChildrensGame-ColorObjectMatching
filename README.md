 Assignment Overview:
  	You are assigned the job of creating the data structures for a small children's game. 
  	To do this you should create an array list of 10 color words and another of 10 names of objects. 
  	There should be one object for each of the color words. Write a program that reads from the two lists, 
  	and stores the 20 items in a linked list. Sort and display the linked list in ascending alphabetical order.
